# StructureFile.py

# 
# this class is made to easily edit .gro structure files
#
# use:
#   create object using an input .gro file
#   can be used as a class or directly using user input
#
#   edit files with .removelines([[pattern, column, argument]])
#       removelines takes a list input of a list containing a pattern (str), column (int), and argument (str)
#           lots of pca lists can be given
#           the argument can either be "include" or "exclude"
#               include is essentially an AND statement with other pca(include)'s for deletion
#               exclude will exclude that line from deletion, despite include statements
#               use includes before excludes, order is otherwise not important
#   examples in main()

#   make _createAtomArray more efficient
